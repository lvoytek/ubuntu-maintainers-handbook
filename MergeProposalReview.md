# Merge Proposal (MP) reviewing

We established a review process before sponsoring or uploading content, which
has helped us maintain consistently high quality.
To do so we propose our changes as [merge proposals against `git-ubuntu` branches](MergeProposal.md).

In this review, we:
* Review formal content for issues
* Ensure adherence to team style guidelines
* Identify common issues
* Conduct further testing (when warranted)

The following states indicate reviewer feedback on each aspect we want to check.

* *OK* - This was checked and there was nothing of concern to be raised.
* *Not OK* - Something is not as it should be and needs to be changed in the proposed content.
* *Question* - Not neccesarily bad, but a detail worth to clarify. This could only need an answer, but might due to the discussion also end up in changes to what was proposed.
* *Not applicable* - The particular check is not applicable to this case
* *Skipped* - Skipped by the reviewer as it seemed not mandatory or commensurate for this case.

## Skipping whole sections

Not every change needs all the checks we have in our template. If you would end
up marking all elements of a section as `skipped` feel free to drop the whole
section to make the post have a lower percentage of noisy non-content text.

A common case for this are the checks in regard to "package merges", "new delta
in debian/", or "new patches".

## How to provide feedback details

On any of these states further context might be given in the line below. That is
entirely optional on "OK" or "Not applicable" and to some extent also for "Skipped" states.
But any "Not OK" and "Question" state the reviewer shall provide some details
to allow the requester to understand and act on it.

Furthermore when providing feedback we strive to follow the style of
[conventional comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/) which allow us to
bring up a lot - thereby helping each other - without locking us too much in
review iterations. Such a simple prefix helps in many common cases, making it
clear if things are blocking or optional.
Reviews do not even need to be only critique, if you see something nice
remember the `praise:` label exists.

## Check the new changelog stanza

* Contains a bug pointer like `(LP: #12345678)` to all associated cases
* Correctly formatted entries according to the [changelog policy](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-source.html#debian-changelog-debian-changelog) and our [hints](PackageMerging.md#fix-the-changelog) for merges
* Lists all changes made - the changelog shall be a complete representation
* Proper version - check against [Version Strings](VersionStrings.md)
* Proper release - `dch` or habits could have selected the wrong one
* Proper author and email

## Ensure Documentation/release Notes are updated

* We always did enqueue things that eventually need to be mentioned in the release notes, this check in the MR review is a reminder about that.
* If the update/merge has implications that need to be documented we always updated documentation alongside changes. Sometimes things get in via a sync or upstream changes, not by us - as we spot these, make sure to spawn a proper backlog tracker for it.

## Check for indirect changes

* Some changes can imply that the packaging needs to be adapted. Check content and release notes if there are any changes like that.
* When merging from Debian or Upstream it is worth checking if there are even newer versions that would be worth it to go for.
  * Bad things happen, check upstream if a release has been withdrawn or needs an immediate fix-up due to unintentional breakage.
* Ensure that the changes in Debian do not imply that we need to update the delta we carry (do not be fooled by applying cleanly)
* Ensure update maintainer has been run

## Check the old delta

* Ensure that everything we dropped really can be dropped
  * vice versa, there could be more that could be dropped (often needs a little test to verify which is suggested to the owner of the MR and only rarely done by the reviewer)

## Check the new delta

* Do the patches [follow DEP-3](http://dep.debian.net/deps/dep3/)
  * You can use dep3changelog to verify the headers, as well as generate a changelog entry.
* Does the patch content and name [follow our additional style choices](DebianPatch.md)?
  * This is not a strict check, but consitency helps to maintain packages together.
* Do the patches match what is (proposed) upstream?
  * To be clear, if a certain case asks for violating this rule it is ok, but it should be a conscious decision not an accident
  * The intention is to avoid deviating the code we maintain too much from how the project continues to evolve (hard to maintain well over long periods).
* Are the patches applied the right way according to `debian/source/format`?
* Are all changes either:
  * Forwarded to Debian or Upstream so that everyone benefits and we can some day make this a sync again.
  * Or if they are Ubuntu only choices, marked like that so the next packager is not wondering if we want to keep or submit it? (See [`UD-forwarded` for commits](CommittingChanges.md#the-commit-message) and [`Forwarded` for patches](DebianPatch.md#the-patchfile-header).
  * If old delta added in the past does not have such info and you spent the effort to check the history and reasoning to make good decisions, please add the same info to that old-delta.

## Check for Git/maintenance

* Changes are logically split into separate commits (to ease future merges and cherry picking to other releases)

## Check for Build and Test

* Verify that the PPA build is successful on all intended architectures.
* If this is an SRU consider checking that the SRU template in the bug is OK. Test instructions especially are often only understandable for the reporter. We want them to be good before SRU review.
* Where applicable, consider whether tests should be added, adapted, or extended to reflect the changes.
* Use autopkgtest on the PPA builds to ensure confidence before archive entry and avoid late discovery of issues that might lead to entanglement in other proposed migrations.
* New runtime dependencies might be added and could cause [component mismatches](ProposedMigration.md#mainuniverse-binary-mismatch). Such would block proposed migration and may necessitate either filing a [MIR](MainInclusion.md) for them or adapting the upload to avoid that dependency.
* Manual installation of packages from the PPA may be performed to verify the builds, but this is optional.
  * Automated testing (autopkgtest) is preferred. Suggest adding DEP8 test cases where it would make sense.
  * In some situations, manual verification of certain behaviors may also be necessary for additional assurance.


# Review template

The following template may be useful when submitting reviews:

```
Review Symbols:
+ = OK
! = Not OK
? = Question
N = Not applicable
S = Skipped

* Changelog:
  - [ ] Changelog entry has correct version and targeted codename
  - [ ] Correct formatting of changelog items
  - [ ] Bug references correct
  - [ ] Old content and logical tag match as expected (Package Merge)

* Release notes and Documentation
  - [ ] Added, updated or enqueued relevant documentation.
  - [ ] Added, updated or enqueued relevant release notes.

* Package Merge - indirect changes:
  - [ ] No upstream changes that need adapting due to Ubuntu's design
  - [ ] No further upstream version/changes to consider
  - [ ] Debian changes are compatible with the Ubuntu implementation
  - [ ] update-maintainer has been run

* Package Merge - old delta:
  - [ ] Dropped changes are ok to be dropped
  - [ ] Nothing else to drop
  - [ ] Old delta was forwarded to upstream/Debian or marked as Ubuntu-only

* New delta in debian/*:
  - [ ] new changes in debian/* are OK
  - [ ] New delta was forwarded to Debian or marked as Ubuntu-only

* New patches:
  - [ ] No new patches added
  - [ ] Patches match those proposed/committed upstream
  - [ ] Patches correctly included in Debian/patches/series
  - [ ] Patches have correct DEP-3 metadata
  - [ ] Patches follow our style choices
  - [ ] New code not from upstream was forwarded or marked as Ubuntu-only

* Git/maintenance:
  - [ ] Commits are properly split (more important on -dev than on SRUs)

* Build/Test:
  - [ ] Build is OK
  - [ ] This is an SRU, the validation instructions are ok
  - [ ] Testcases added or adapted (N/A if not strictly required or already present)
  - [ ] autopkgtest against the PPA package passes (if possible, evidence was provided already)
  - [ ] Based on PPA builds and the build-log, no new component mismatch expected
  - [ ] Verified PPA package installs/uninstalls
  - [ ] Verified function manually
```
